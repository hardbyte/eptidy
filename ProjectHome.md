# What does it do? #
Tidy up all your tv episodes. Rename and move your files in the way and location of your choice.  Downloads episode names from imdb and renames them in the format you specify all from a cross platform native looking gui.  Easily extended and editable to support other tv shows. Eptidy supports proxy setting.

# How to use eptidy #
Eptidy manages your collection of TV episodes
by scanning their file names, determining season
and episode numbers, and retrieving the corresponding
episode name from IMDB.

You can use this program to organise your
episodes with your preferred naming convention
and folder hierachy

Firstly, select a path by typing it in or using
the browse button, and choose whether you want
a recursive scan. Press Scan to have Eptidy
generate a list of all the episodes in that
location. Type in or select from the drop-down
list a naming convention (for help on these see
the naming pattern help option) and press Process.
After retrieving episode names from IMDB, Eptidy
will produce a list of proposed renames. Select
those you wish to make and press Rename Files.

The standalone exe for version 0.3 currently runs under windows 2000, windows xp, windows vista and wine.

## The simple way - (download the standalone executable file) ##
Download the standalone executable and run it... thats the program.

An alternative to the standalone executable is to download the installer which installs python 2.5 and wxWidgets so the program runs natively.
